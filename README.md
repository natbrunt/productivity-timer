# React + Vite

Now what should this app do?  It should use sound, like a nice bell sound or something more cyber punk,
like a low rumble, or a high beep.  Not sure where to get these assets, I'm assuming that,
there are free source sound effects for timers on the net somewhere.

It should contain a notes section with a simple markdown editor for note taking

It should be able to get the time on the current pc and use this to display the time
on the cyber scheduler

When a timer is up or an activity is due to happen then a sound notification should appear
The due event should be highlighted with a pulsing border from the net css animations cheatsheet

Ultimately, it is a cyber scheduler
and a timer built in.

There is no complex ui ux because the needed values are hard coded into the program.
